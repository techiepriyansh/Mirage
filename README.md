GeoGuessr is an exciting and educational game that challenges players to explore random locations on a map and guess where they are, blending geography knowledge with the thrill of discovery. It's a fun way to learn about the world while competing against others or testing your own skills.

ZeoKuessr enhances this experience by introducing a competitive edge through crypto staking, where players can wager on their geographical knowledge. The integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and trusted execution environments (TEE) ensures a fair, tamper-proof environment, making the game even more engaging by adding transparency and trust to the competition. Itâ€™s a next-level evolution of GeoGuessr for those looking for both fun and fairness in their gameplay.

The game utilizes the Google Maps API to present the players with a world map and a random Google Street View image of any random location in the world. The players must then connect their wallets to play and bet on their geographical prowess by staking an amount. The winnings are split in the ratio of how close your guess on the map is to the actual location. For creating a fair decentralized environment and game states, we use Oasis Sapphire and ROFL for communication with the Oracle contract. For fetching the image securely we use Sign protocol. We also used Metamask for wallet integration.
